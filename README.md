# Northwind API Sampler
This project is meant to enable exploration and comparison 
between different API technologies within ASP.NET Core:

* REST / JSON 
* GraphQL
* gRPC

## Running the project 
It relies on a localhost instance of Postgres containing the Northwind database.

If you have Docker desktop installed, the repo below has some instructions on getting the database set up.
https://github.com/dahlsailrunner/northwind_psql

Clone the repo and build it, then run.

It should open a browser to the Home page, with links across the top for the Swagger interface and the GraphQL playground.
